Overview

This project applies Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health metrics. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is used to analyze various medical attributes and classify individuals as Diabetic or Non-Diabetic.

Features

✅ Feature Selection – Uses medical parameters like glucose levels, BMI, insulin, and age.

✅ KNN Model Optimization – Evaluates multiple k values for the best accuracy.

✅ Accuracy Analysis – Plots accuracy scores for different k values.

✅ Train-Test Split – Splits dataset into training and testing for model evaluation.

✅ Diabetes Prediction – Takes new patient data and predicts Diabetic/Non-Diabetic status.

Tech Stack

🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

🔹 Machine Learning (KNN Classifier, Accuracy Metrics)

🔹 Data Visualization (Accuracy vs. k-value plots)

Usage

1️⃣ Prepare Dataset – Load patient data and preprocess features (X) and labels (y).

2️⃣ Optimize KNN – Test different k values to find the best-performing model.

3️⃣ Train & Evaluate – Train the final KNN model and measure accuracy.

4️⃣ Predict Diabetes – Input new patient health metrics for a diabetes prediction.

🚀 A simple yet effective ML approach for diabetes risk assessment!
